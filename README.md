# Numerical-Methods Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository for all the class projects I've worked on. Each project is stored in its own branch to help organize and manage them efficiently.

## Projects

### Project 1: Scaled Partial Pivoting
- Branch: project-1
- Description: The program solves systems of linear equations using Gaussian elimination with Scaled Partial Pivoting. It provides the intermediate steps, including scaled ratios and pivot row selection, and outputs the final solution in a user-friendly format.

### Project 2: Iterative Solutions of Linear Systems
- Branch: project-2
- Description: The program solves systems of linear equations using the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel iterative methods. It checks for convergence with user-specified errors and provides the solution at each iteration.

### Project 3: TBD
- Branch: project-3
- Description: TBD

## Getting Started
